# Overview page

The overview page should provide a high-level summary of the project's activity, contributors, and performance metrics, including:

* The number of contributors and their distribution by location or organization.
* The total number of commits, pull requests, and issues.
* The average time to resolve issues and merge pull requests.
* The overall health of the codebase, including code quality and security vulnerabilities.
* The level of community engagement, such as the number of forum posts or comments on pull requests.

The analytics tools on the overview page provide a range of features and visualizations that can help you gain insights into the project's performance, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions about development and collaboration.
