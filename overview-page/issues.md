# Issues

The **Issue Metric** measures the number of issues reported and tracked within a specified period. It compares the number of issues opened and the number of issues closed in the selected time period.

### Why is this metric important?

* **Issues Tracking and Management:** By visualizing the data on a line chart, it becomes easier to identify the increase or decrease in issue activity, allowing for effective resource allocation and prioritization.
* **Performance Evaluation:** The **Issue Metric** helps in evaluating the performance of the development team and the project as a whole. Changes in issue count over time indicate improvements in software quality, bug-fixing efficiency, or the impact of development efforts.
* **Community Engagement:** A higher number of reported issues indicates the active participation and involvement of the community in the open source project.

### Interact with the chart
