# Stars

The **Star Metric** measures and analyzes the number of stars a project receives on a code hosting platform like GitHub.

The metric gives you a real-time data analysis of projects' popularity, community engagement, and overall project visibility.

Stars represent a way for you to bookmark or indicate your interest in and appreciation for a particular project. Each star serves as a measure of the project's popularity.
