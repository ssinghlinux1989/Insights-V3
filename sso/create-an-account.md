# Create an Account

When you log in for the first time to any Linux Foundation-managed service that is protected with Single Sign On (SSO), you must create an account. To create an LF account, follow these steps:

1\. Navigate to the [LFX Platform](http://lfx.linuxfoundation.org) and click **CREATE LFX PROFILE (2)** at the top right corner of the main menu. Alternatively, you can also click the **Create Your LFX Profile** (3) link from the page. If you already have an LF profile, click **My LF Profile (1)** to go to the next page.
