# Sign in with Facebook

You can use your Facebook login to access the protected Linux Foundation service instead of creating an LF account. The first time, you will enter your **Facebook** credentials to authenticate your account. Subsequent logins will just require a click on the Facebook icon. This one-click approach simplifies the login process.

3\. If you have an existing LF account, the Linux Foundation will map it to your Facebook login. If you don't have an LF Account associated with the email address you're using, you will be navigated to **Create your LF Account** page.
