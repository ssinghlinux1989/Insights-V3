# Individual Contributor

As an individual contributor, you are contributing code on your own behalf (not on behalf of an employer). You create a pull request in GitHub or submit changed code in Gerrit to inform reviewers about the changes. During the process, your CLA is verified, and you must sign a CLA if you have not already signed, before you can contribute to GitHub or Gerrit.

* [GitHub](individual-contributor.md#github)
* [Gerrit](individual-contributor.md#gerrit)
