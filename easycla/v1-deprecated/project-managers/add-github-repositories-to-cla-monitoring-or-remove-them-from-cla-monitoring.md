4\. For the repository that you want to configure, click an option:

* **ADD** adds the repository to the CLA group and to CLA monitoring. After you add a repository, the REMOVE option becomes available next to the repository.
* **REMOVE** disables CLA enforcement on the repository. After you remove a repository, the ADD option appears next to the repository.
* **REMOVE** removes the repository from the CLA group and CLA monitoring. After you remove a repository, the ADD option appears next to the repository.
* **DISABLED** indicates that the repository has been configured for another CLA group and thus cannot be configured for the selected CLA group.
