# Add Contributor License Agreements

The CLA Management Console lets you select a template style to use for your Corporate CLA and Individual CLA.

In some circumstances, you need to change the legal text of the CLA agreement in major and minor revisions:

* A major revision (for example, a change to your charter) is one in which you are legally required to have all contributors re-sign the revised agreement.
* A minor revision is one that does not change a legal perspective and contributors do not need to re-sign the revised agreement.

In these cases, you simply add the updated CLA using the same procedure as for adding the initial CLA.

_Verify that the pop-up blocker is disabled on your browser before you begin this procedure._

2\. Click a **project** of interest.

3\. Go to the CLA group to which you want to add a CLA and click **SELECT TEMPLATE**.\
