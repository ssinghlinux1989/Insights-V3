# Get Access to EasyCLA

{% hint style="info" %}
**Prerequisites:**

* Ensure that your project meets the [EasyCLA Requirements](easycla-requirements.md).
* Ensure that you have an LF Single Sign-on (SSO) account, [create an account](broken-reference) if you do not have an SSO account.
{% endhint %}

**To get access to EasyCLA:**

1. Share your username with the EasyCLA administration team at [docucla@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:docucla@linuxfoundation.org).
2. Provide sample ICLA and CCLA template documents to the EasyCLA administration team at [docucla@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:docucla@linuxfoundation.org).

After the EasyCLA administration team confirms your setup, you can [Sign In to the EasyCLA Management Console](../project-managers/sign-in-to-the-easycla-management-console.md) to do the EasyCLA activities as a [project manager](../project-managers/).

**Note:** CLA managers can immediately start using the EasyCLA Corporate Console because it does not require activation from the EasyCLA administration team. Simply [Sign In to the EasyCLA Corporate Console](../cla-manager/sign-in-to-the-easycla-corporate-console.md) to do the EasyCLA activities for [CLA Managers](../cla-manager/).
