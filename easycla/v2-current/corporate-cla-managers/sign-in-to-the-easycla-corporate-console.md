A CLA Manager (or someone who will become an initial CLA Manager after a CCLA is signed) must sign in to the corporate console in order to [coordinate the CCLA signing process](coordinate-signing-cla-and-become-initial-cla-manager.md), and to perform other activities.

1. Go to [https://organization.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/company/dashboard](https://organization.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/company/dashboard).
2. Enter your credentials and click **SIGN IN**.

After signing in, the EasyCLA Corporate Console appears and shows projects for which EasyCLA is enabled.
