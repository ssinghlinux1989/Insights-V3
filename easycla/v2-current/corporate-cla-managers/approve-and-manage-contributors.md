# Approve and Manage Contributors

After a company signs a CCLA, the company's CLA Managers can approve their company's employees to contribute by adding them to their Approved List for that project. **Approved Lists** are lists of domain names, email addresses of individuals, GitHub usernames, GitHub organization names, that allow contributors to be authorized to contribute under the signed CCLA.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** CLA Managers may receive an email after a contributor sends a request to be added to the Approved list. To approve them, the CLA Manager must add their email address or GitHub username to the approved list.
{% endhint %}

As a CLA manager for a project, you can:

* ​[Add Contributors to the project's Approved List](approve-and-manage-contributors.md#add-contributor-s)​
* ​[Edit the details for an Approved List criteria](approve-and-manage-contributors.md#edit-a-contributors-details)​
* ​[Delete a Contributor from the project's Approved List](approve-and-manage-contributors.md#delete-a-contributors-details)​

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Before doing any of the following actions, you must first be a CLA Manager under a signed CCLA. If your company has not yet signed a CCLA, you will need to first [coordinate the CCLA signing process](coordinate-signing-cla-and-become-initial-cla-manager.md).
