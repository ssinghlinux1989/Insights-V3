## Project Hierarchy

In the user interface, some projects are nested under parent projects or foundations that they are contained in. The data shown for a parent project or foundation is an aggregate of all the projects under it. The following sections show CLA information for a project based on:

* [If company has signed CLA](https://github.com/communitybridge/docs/blob/master/easycla/v2-current/corporate-cla-console/broken-reference/README.md)
* [If company has not signed CLA](https://github.com/communitybridge/docs/blob/master/easycla/v2-current/corporate-cla-console/broken-reference/README.md)

## If Company has signed CLA

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** The CLA Managers for a project can edit their company's EasyCLA settings (such as authorized contributors approval lists) for only the project(s) where they are the CLA Managers. Others (such as CLA Managers for other projects, or other roles) will have read-only access but cannot change the company's EasyCLA settings for the project.
