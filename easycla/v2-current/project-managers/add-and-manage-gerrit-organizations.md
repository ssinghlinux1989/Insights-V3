# Add and Manage Gerrit Organizations

Before you can add or manage Gerrit organizations and repositories, you must connect or add Gerrit organizations while setting up IT services. However, you can also add Gerrit organization in the Gerrit pane of **Tools** tab.

* ​[Add Gerrit Organization​](add-and-manage-gerrit-organizations.md#add-gerrit-organization)
* ​[Disassociate Gerrit Organization​](add-and-manage-gerrit-organizations.md#disassociate-gerrit-organization)

After you successfully add Git organizations, you can:

* ​[View Connection Status of Git Organization and Repositories​](view-connection-status-of-git-organizations-and-repositories.md)
* ​[Enforce or Remove CLA Mechanism for Gerrit Repositories​](enforce-or-remove-cla-mechanism.md#enforce-cla-mechanism-for-gerrit-repositories)

**Notes:**

* Contact the Linux Foundation IT team to get Gerrit Instance Name and URL.
* Contact the Linux Foundation IT team if you do not know the LDAP Group IDs.

The EasyCLA project console lists the CLA-enabled instances, as shown below.​​

**Note:** You cannot disable the CLA check for individual Gerrit repositories.
