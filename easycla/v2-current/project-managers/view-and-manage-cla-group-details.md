# View and Manage CLA Group Details

A Project Manager can view CLA group details and can update a CLA group details by updating or deleting a CLA group name, [updating a CLA template](update-template.md), and [invalidating a contributor's signature](invalidate-a-contributors-signature.md).

1. Sign in to the [Project Control Center](https://projectadmin.lfx.linuxfoundation.org).
2. Click a **project name** of interest.
3. Scroll down to **Tools Status** section, and click **EasyCLA**. The EasyCLA Overview page appears.

The Overview page displays CLA groups that have been added to the project, [details for each CLA group](view-and-manage-cla-group-details.md#cla-group-details), and [activity log](view-and-manage-cla-group-details.md#activity-log) table. A CLA group defines a CCLA and/or ICLA that contributors must sign.
