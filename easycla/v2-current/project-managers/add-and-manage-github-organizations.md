# Add and Manage GitHub Organizations

Before you can add or manage GitHub organizations and repositories, you must connect or add GitHub organizations while setting up IT services. However, you can also add GitHub organization in the GitHub pane of **Tools** tab.

* ​[Add GitHub Organization](add-and-manage-github-organizations.md#add-github-organization)​

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

If you select **Only select repositorie**s, then a newly added repository to the GitHub organization will not be reflected automatically under the project's GitHub organization page in Project Console.​​
{% endhint %}

12\. Navigate to the Project Control Center, and click **I'm Done Installing**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** To enable a CLA mechanism on a repository, you must [enforce CLA mechanism for GitHub repositories](enforce-or-remove-cla-mechanism.md#enforce-or-remove-cla-mechanism-from-github-repositories). Simply adding a GitHub organization to the project does not enable the EasyCLA mechanism for any CLA groups.
