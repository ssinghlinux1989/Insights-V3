### **Change Status**

Select a value from the **Tasks** **Status** drop-down list: In Progress, Submitted, Completed.\
When you update a task, the mentee receives an email informing them that the task is updated.

**Note:** Mentees can also change status of a task to either In Progress or Submitted by navigating to their accounts. If Mentees change their status, the same status also reflects on you.
