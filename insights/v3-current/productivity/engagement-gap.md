### Why is this metric important?

* **Performance Assessment:** The **Engagement Gap** metric enables you to assess the project's overall engagement level by comparing it to the expected or desired level. It provides a quantitative measure of how actively contributors are participating and helps identify any gaps between the expected and actual engagement levels.
* **Community Health:** The **Engagement Gap** metric provides valuable insights into the health and dynamics of the project community. Large engagement gaps may indicate potential challenges, such as communication issues, a lack of mentorship, or unclear contribution guidelines.
