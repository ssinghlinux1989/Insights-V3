# Engagement Gap

The **Engagement Gap** metric measures the difference between expected and actual levels of contributor engagement. The dashboard shows the ratio of the difference between the contributor who comments the most over PRs vs. the contributor who comments the least.

### Why is this metric important?

* **Performance Assessment:** The **Engagement Gap** metric enables you to assess the project's overall engagement level by comparing it to the expected or desired level. It provides a quantitative measure of how actively contributors are participating and helps identify any gaps between the expected and actual engagement levels.
* **Community Health:** The **Engagement Gap** metric provides valuable insights into the health and dynamics of the project community. Large engagement gaps may indicate potential challenges, such as communication issues, a lack of mentorship, or unclear contribution guidelines.
