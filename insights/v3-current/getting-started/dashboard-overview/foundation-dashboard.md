<summary>How the project velocity is calculated?</summary>

The velocity is calculated based on the activity in the project. The logarithmic values of these metrics are used to normalize the data and make it easier to compare across different projects.

To compute velocity, the following metrics are used:

* Commits - number of commits
* Pull Requests - The number of pull requests opened
* Issues - The number of issues opened
* Contributors - number of contributors who made the above kinds of contributions (i.e. Commits, Pull Requests, Issues)
