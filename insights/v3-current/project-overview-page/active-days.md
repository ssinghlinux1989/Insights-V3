# Active Days

The **Active Days** metric measures the number of days a contributor has made at least one contribution to a project. It counts the number of days on which a contributor has been actively engaged in the project's development.

The active days metric can be used to compare the activity levels of different projects. This can be helpful in deciding which project to contribute to or invest in.

The Active Days dashboard provides you with the following insights:

1. You can monitor progress and identify trends. This information can be used to set goals and benchmarks for the project and measure success.
2. The active days metric provides a quick snapshot of the project's activity level. It helps determine whether the project is actively maintained or not.
3. The visualization can be used to quickly assess the activity level of a repository. A repository with a high number of active days is likely to be more active and healthy than one with a low number of active days.
4. By highlighting the importance of active days, project managers can encourage new contributors to become more involved in the project.
