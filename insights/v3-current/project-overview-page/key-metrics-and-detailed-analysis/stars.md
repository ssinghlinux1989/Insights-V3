# Stars

The **Star Metric** measures and analyzes the number of stars a project receives on a code hosting platform like GitHub.

The metric gives you a real-time data analysis of projects' popularity, community engagement, and overall project visibility.

Stars represent a way for you to bookmark or indicate your interest in and appreciation for a particular project. Each star serves as a measure of the project's popularity.

### Interact with the chart

To analyze the **Star Metric**, the analytics tool employs a line chart on its dashboard. The line connecting the data points on the chart showcases the trend and changes in the number of stars over time.&#x20;

When you hover over a specific point on the line chart, detailed information about the number of stars for that particular month within the selected period is displayed.
