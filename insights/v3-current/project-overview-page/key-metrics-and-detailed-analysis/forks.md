# Forks

The **Fork Metric** measures and analyzes the number of times a project has been forked by other developers.&#x20;

Forking is the process of creating a copy of a project's source code repository to either modify and enhance the project or use it as a starting point for a new project.

### Why is this metric important?

* **How popular is the project?:** The **Fork Metric** provides insights into the popularity of your project. A higher number of forks generally indicates that the developers find your project useful and valuable enough to build it or adapt it to their specific needs.
* **Code Reuse:** By analyzing the Fork Metric, you can get data on code reuse and identify potential opportunities for improvement.
* **Community Engagement:**  A growing number of forks indicates an active and involved community, contributing to the project's growth.
* **Project Evolution:**  By monitoring forks over time, you can identify significant milestones.
