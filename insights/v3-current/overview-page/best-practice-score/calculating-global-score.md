# Calculating Global Score

Calculating a global score for a best practice score in an open-source project involves evaluating various aspects of the project against predefined best practices and assigning weights to those aspects based on their importance. Let's understand this with the sample example.

Define the following set of best practices that are important for the success and quality of the open-source project. Each category should have a set of criteria that can be evaluated.

### Assign Weights

Assign weights to each category based on their relative importance. These weights should add up to 100%. The weights reflect how much each category contributes to the overall quality of the project.
