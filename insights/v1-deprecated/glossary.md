# Glossary

Insights uses the following common terms in the product documentation and in the user interface:

### Active contributors

It refers to those [contributors](glossary.md#contributor) who are contributing to the project or contributed to the project in the last six month from the current date.

### Affiliated contributor:

A [contributor ](glossary.md#contributor)who is committing code or participating in the project _on behalf of an organization_.

### Author

An _author_ is the person who originally wrote a piece of code in Git.

### Backlog

A _backlog_ is a list of all things that need to be done within a project.

### Backlog Management Index

_Backlog Management Index_ (BMI) is the number of closed issues divided by the number of open ones in a given period of time.

### Branch

A Git _branch_ is an independent line of development. A branch lets you isolate your work from others. Changes in the primary branch or other branches do not affect your branch, unless you decide to pull the latest changes from those branches.

Atlassian _Confluence_ is a content tool that teams use to collaborate and share knowledge. Confluence lets users create pages and blogs, which all team members can comment on and edit.

### Contributor

A _Contributor_ is someone (typically a developer) who contributes code to a GitHub/Gerrit/GitLab project.

### Contribution

A _contribution_ is a review, comment, commit, issue, or pull request. A _contributor_ is someone from the outside not on the core development team of the project that wants to contribute some changes to a project, but does not have collaborator access.

### Churn rate

Churn rate is defined as the total number of inactive contributors. It is calculated as:\
_`Total Inactive Contributors recorded at the end of the time period/ (Total Active Contributors recorded at the start + Total New Contributors who joined during the selected time period)`_

### Dashboard

A _dashboard_ is a data visualization that displays analytics metrics and important data points for an organization, a project, and other data on a single page.

### Data affiliation

_Data affiliation_ connects or associates identities. Affiliation is a close association or connection to an organization, company, and so on. An example of affiliation is being a member of a community organization. Or, a member could belong to two or more companies that are related through common ownership, but are treated as one. In this case, a single member might have multiple identities such as two different company emails.

### Data Source

Data sources are the collaboration tools or the remote servers that are used by projects to drive the development of a project. For example, in a database management system, the primary data source is the database, which can be located in a disk or a remote server. The data source for a computer program can be a file, a data sheet, a spreadsheet, an XML file or even hard-coded data within the program.

### Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

_Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)_ development is software developed by informal collaborative networks of programmers.

### Gerrit

_Gerrit_ is a free web-based team code collaboration tool. Software developers in a team can review each other's modifications on their source code using a Web browser and approve or reject those changes. Gerrit integrates closely with Git.

### Git

_Git_ is an open source program for tracking changes in source code during software development.

### GitHub ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/18088191 (4) (3).png>)

_GitHub_ is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.

### Identity

In Identity Management, an _identity_ is a record (tuple) composed of a name, email, username, and the name of the source from where it was extracted.

### Inactive contributors

It refers to those [contributors](glossary.md#contributor) who did not contribute to the project in the last six month from the current date.

### Individual contributors

Individual [contributors](glossary.md#contributor) are those who are contributing to the project in an individual capacity, such as freelancers, and do not have affiliation to any organization.

### Issue

In GitHub, an _issue_ is a suggested improvement, task, or question that is related to the repository. Anyone can create an issue (for public repositories). Issues are moderated by repository collaborators.

### Jenkins

_Jenkins_ is an open source continuous integration software tool for testing and reporting on changes in a code base in real time.

### Jira ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/18088260 (3) (3) (3) (3) (1).png>)

_Jira_ is an issue tracking product that allows bug tracking and agile project management.

### Label

A _label_ is a classifying name or phrase on a project that identifies subjects for the project repositories.

### Mailing list

A _mailing list_ is a list of email addresses that allows for a wide distribution of information to many Internet users.

### New contributor

A new contributor is someone who has never contributed to the project before, and is contributing for the first time.

### Onion model analysis

In GitHub, _onion model analysis_ defines the number and identity of core, regular, and casual contributors. These contributors are individuals who have done 80 percent (core), 15 percent (regular), and 5 percent (casual) of the contributions to a project.

### Open source community

The _open source community_ is a body of programmers who develop and participate in computer programs in which the source code is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. open source code is a collaborative effort, where programmers improve the source code and share the changes within the community.

### Organization

In GitHub, an _organization_ is a collection of user accounts that own repositories. Organizations let businesses and open source projects collaborate across many projects at once.

### Patch

A _patch_ is a set of changes to a computer program to update, fix, or improve it the program. In Git, a _patch_ is a small file that indicates what was changed in a repository.

### Project

A _project_ defines any open source collaborative effort, which can be a specific repository (for example, [FOSS](glossary.md#free-and-open-source-software-foss)), a coalition of like projects (for example, LF Energy), or a formal organization, for example, Cloud Native Computing Foundation). Other project definitions follow:

* Public domain project—A non-Linux Foundation project that is managed independently of the Linux Foundation, but that is participating in one or more Linux Foundation services (for example, Express Gateway, Vue.js).
* Member project—A Linux Foundation project that maintains its own governance and membership (for example, Cloud Native Computing Foundation or LF Networking).
* Nonmember project—A Linux Foundation project that does not maintain its own formal governance and membership, but is instead directly managed by the Linux Foundation, for example [FOSS](glossary.md#free-and-open-source-software-foss).
* Member subproject—A Linux Foundation project whose governance and membership is managed using a parent member project, but may also provide its own limited, more focused, governance (for example, Kubernetes).

### Pull request

A _pull request_ (PR) is a proposed change to a repository that is submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by repository collaborators.

### Push

A _push_ refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository. A _pusher_ is someone who sends committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub.

### Repository

A _repository_ is an element in GitHub that contains all the project files (including documentation) and stores each file's revision history.

### Review Efficiency Index

_Review Efficiency Index_ (REI) is the number of closed pull requests divided by the number of open ones in a given period of time.

### Slack ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/18088264 (2) (2) (2).png>)

_Slack_ is a cloud-based set of team collaboration tools and services.

### Submit

A _submit_ is an action that lets you comment on a pull request, approve proposed changes, or request changes that must be addressed before the pull request can be merged. A _submitter_ is someone who performs the submit.

### Unaffiliated contributors

Unaffiliated contributors are those contributors who are contributing (or have contributed) to the project but their organization association is still '_Unknown_'.

### Unique commits

Unique commits are identified based on the _SHA_ (_Secure Hash Algorithm)_ associated with a commit. For multiple entries for a single commit, the number of unique commits are considered as _one_ because unique commits are filtered based on the unique SHA of the commit.

### Unique contributors

Contribution by contributors/developers based on their [UUID](glossary.md#uuid)s. For example, if _ten_ contributors have pushed 20 commits each, the number of _unique contributors_ will be considered as _10_, not 200 as it is the total number of commits.

### Unique repository

The repositories based on their unique names. It refers to the complete path (also called _origin_) of the repository URL.

### UUID

Universally Unique Identifier. The author UUID is given by LFX Insights based on the GitHub username, name, and email address of a contributor.

### Visualization

A _visualization_ is data that is represented in a visual context such as a graph or chart. Patterns, trends, and correlations can be exposed in a data visualization.
