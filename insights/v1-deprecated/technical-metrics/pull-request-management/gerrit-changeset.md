# Gerrit Changeset

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, Bots and Changesets Only are filtered. Dashboard shows data only for number of changesets, not for comments, approvals, and other values. Empty changesets— Changesets that have value as zero— are also filtered. To add/manage filters, see [Add and Manage Data Filters](../../filter-data/add-and-manage-data-filters.md).

* [Timing](gerrit-changeset.md#timing)
* [Backlog](gerrit-changeset.md#backlog)
* [Approvals](gerrit-changeset.md#approvals)
* [Reviews](gerrit-changeset.md#reviews)

By default, **Bots** and **Changesets Only** filters are applied. To apply more filters, see [add and manage data filters](../../filter-data/add-and-manage-data-filters.md).
