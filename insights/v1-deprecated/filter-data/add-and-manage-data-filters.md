# Add and Manage Data Filters

On a dashboard, you can add a filter for the data results and display only the data that contain a particular value. You can also create negative filters that exclude data that contain the specified value. Filtering makes it easier for you to focus on specific information on a dashboard. The applied filters are shown in the query bar. Negative filters start with **NOT** in red.

After you add a filter, you can manage it by applying quick actions on the filter label such as excluding matches, and editing or removing the filter.

### Add a Filter <a href="#addandmanagedatafilters-addafilter" id="addandmanagedatafilters-addafilter"></a>

1. On a data source dashboard, for example Technical Metrics > Source Control > Commits > Overview, click + **Add filter**.
2. Click in the **Filter** field and:
   * Select a filter from the **Field** drop-down list.\
     ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/add filter.png>)
   * Select an operator from the **Operato**r drop-down list
   * Type or select a filter value in the **Value** field.\
     **Note:** You can turn on the **Create** **Custom label?** key to open **Custom label** field that lets you enter a label value that identifies your filter subject.
3. Click **Edit as Query DSL** to build a filter using Elastic search Query DSL. You can create positive and negative operators and filter on whether or not a field is present.\
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/edit as query DSL.png>) \\
4. Click **Save**.\
   The filter label appears in the query bar.
5. (Optional) Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/change filter icon.png>) to display and hide the **CHANGE ALL FILTERS** options as shown in the following example:\
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/change filter options.png>)
   * **Enable all** enables all the disabled filters.
   * **Disable** **all** disables the filters without removing them. Strike-through indicates that filters are disabled.
   * **Pin all** pins the filters. Pinned filters persist when you switch contexts. For example, you can pin a filter in one dashboard and it remains in place when you switch to another dashboard. A filter is based on a particular index field—if the indices being searched do not contain the field in a pinned filter, it has no effect.
   * **Unpin all** disables all pinned filters.
   * **Invert inclusion** switches the positive filters to negative filters and vice-versa.
   * **Invert enabled/disabled** switches the enabled filters to disabled filters and vice-versa.
   * **Remove all** removes all the filters from the action bar.
