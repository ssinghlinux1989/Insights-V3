# New Contributors

The **New Contributors Dashboard** analyzes the participation of new contributors in the project. It provides a leaderboard of the number of new contributors and ranks them based on their contributions over a selected period.

### Analyze the dashboard

### Why is this metric important?

* **Sustainability and Succession Planning:** The continuous involvement of new contributors ensures the long-term sustainability of open-source projects. As existing contributors may move on or take up different responsibilities, new contributors play a vital role in filling those gaps.
* **Fresh Perspectives and Ideas:** New contributors bring fresh perspectives, ideas, and diverse skill sets to the project. They may offer innovative solutions, identify areas for improvement, and contribute to the overall project evolution.
