# Drifting Away Contributors

The **Drifting Away Contributors** metric focuses on identifying contributors who were once active in an open-source project but have gradually become less engaged over time.

**Drifting Away Contributors** are:

* Users who made at least 5 code contributions at all times for the project.
* At least one of those contributions must be made in the last 6 months.
* The contributor disappeared over the last 3 months.

### Why is this metric important?

The **Drifting Away Contributors** metric is essential for maintaining a healthy and active contributor community. By identifying contributors who are gradually becoming less engaged, project managers can take proactive measures to understand their reasons for disengagement and find ways to re-engage them.
