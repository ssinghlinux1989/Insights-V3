# Productivity

A **Productivity** page provides consolidated insights to enhance efficiency and measure productivity in software development.&#x20;

It offers visual representations of data, such as commits per active day, New contributors, Drifting away contributors, Engagement gap, Work time distribution impact, and Effort by pull request size, allowing contributors and project managers to monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and optimize workflows.&#x20;

By providing real-time information and actionable analytics, the productivity dashboard empowers open source projects to make data-driven decisions, improve collaboration, and deliver high-quality software more effectively.
