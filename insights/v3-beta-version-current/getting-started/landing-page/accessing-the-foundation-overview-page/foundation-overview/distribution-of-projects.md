# Distribution of Projects

The metric categorizes your projects based on their maturity level and rating.&#x20;

This helps you to see how projects are distributed across different levels of maturity and ratings, allowing you to make informed decisions about resource allocation and project management.

At each maturity level projects are further segregated as per rating.

<details>

<summary>Rating</summary>

Ratings are based on the cumulative best practice scores of the projects.

1. A \[75-100]
2. B \[50-74]
3. C \[25-49]
4. D \[0-24]

**For example:** Click on the pie chart under the **Incubating** Projects card to see the projects' categorization as per the ratings.
