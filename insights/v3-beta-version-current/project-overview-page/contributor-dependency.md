### Why is this metric important?

* **Collaboration:** It identifies which contributors frequently interact, exchange ideas, review each other's work, and collaborate on code changes.
* **Knowledge Sharing and Expertise:** Understanding these dependencies can help project maintainers identify subject matter experts, encourage knowledge sharing, and allocate resources effectively.
* **Project Health and Sustainability:** By analyzing **Contributor Dependency**, project maintainers can evaluate the health and sustainability of the project. Dependencies that are concentrated around a few contributors may pose risks if those contributors become less active or leave the project.
