# Commits

The **Commits** metric refers to the analysis of contributor's code commits within a specified timeframe. A code commit represents a unit of change to the software's source code repository.

Each commit includes the following:

* `committed-commit` ("Default Branch" only)

{% hint style="info" %}
In this chart, only commits are counted, not the **Roles**. Each commit with a unique **Commit SHA** is counted as one Commit. The roles do not matter here.
{% endhint %}

### Interact with the chart

The dashboard shows the commits snapshot and a detailed chart. The detailed chart is a combined chart (line chart and bar chart) that shows new commits vs. total commits.

1. On the **Overview** page, select the project and repositories (1) for which you want to see the data.
2. Select the specific period using the filter option (2).
3. The high-level tile (3) shows you the total commits for the selected time range.
4. The detailed analysis chart shows you the New commits and the [cumulative](contributor.md#:\~:text=Cumulative%20chart%20description) count of total commits for the selected period. On the left side, the chart shows the chart trend summary (4). &#x20;

5. Hover over the chart (5) to see the new commits and the total commits for the selected month.
6. This interactive download feature (6) enables you to download the chart in CSV and PNG file formats.

### Why is this metric important?

The metric enables project maintainers and stakeholders to gain valuable insights into code changes and progress within a specified period.

* It provides insights into the volume and frequency of code changes made by contributors. By visualizing commit data in a bar chart, you can track the progress of development efforts over time.
* Changes in commit counts provide periods of intense development, periods of slower activity, or the impact of specific events or milestones on the project.
