# Organization Leaderboard

The **Organization Leaderboard** ranks organizations based on their contributions to the project. The leaderboard provides insights into the collective efforts of organizations to drive the success and growth of your projects.

It helps you determine if your project has a healthy contribution from multiple organizations and if new organizations are coming to contribute to the project.
