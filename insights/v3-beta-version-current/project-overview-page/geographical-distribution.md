# Geographical Distribution

**Insights V3** often incorporates a **Geographical Distribution** metric to provide insights into the locations from which contributions originate.

**Geographical Distribution** analyzes and visualizes the contributions made by contributors across different regions around the world. It provides a breakdown of the top regions based on the total number of contributions, providing a clear understanding of the project's global engagement and scope.

### Why is this metric important?

* **Global Impact:** Geographical Distribution allows you to assess the global impact of the open source project by providing insights into the regions where contributions are coming from.
* **Regional Comparison:** Compare the contribution numbers across different regions to identify any notable variations. Assess whether certain regions show consistent contribution levels or if there are fluctuations that require further investigation.
* **Top Contributing Regions:** It helps to identify the top five regions based on the total number of contributions. These regions represent areas where the project has significant engagement and impact.
