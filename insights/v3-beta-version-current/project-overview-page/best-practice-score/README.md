# Best Practice Score

A best practice score visualization is a tool that helps project leads and managers assess the overall health and quality of an open source software project.

It typically evaluates the project against a set of best practices or standards for software development, such as the categories **`Documentation`**`,`**`Standards`**`,`**`Security`**` `` `**`` Legal` and `Reliance` ``.**&#x20;

It generates a score or rating based on how well the project meets these criteria.
