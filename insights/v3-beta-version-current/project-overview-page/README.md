* The number of contributors and their distribution by location or organization.
* The total number of commits, pull requests, and issues.
* The average time to resolve issues and merge pull requests.
* The overall health of the codebase, including code quality and security vulnerabilities.
* The level of community engagement, such as the number of comments on pull requests.
