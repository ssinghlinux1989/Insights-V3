# Landing Page

The **Landing Page** provides you with all the important analytics about your foundations and projects. It is designed to give you a quick overview of your data and help you navigate the tool easily.

This page focuses on the **Foundation Cards** and the individual **Project Cards**, which serve as the core navigational elements, presenting the key data metrics.

2. **Foundation Cards:** Foundation Cards are like summary cards that provide key insights into different open source foundations. When you click on one of these cards, you will be redirected to a [**Foundation Overview**](../../getting-started/landing-page/accessing-the-foundation-overview-page/foundation-overview.md) dashboard specifically dedicated to that foundation.

When you click on a foundation card that has only one project, you will be redirected to the [**Project Overview**](../../project-overview-page/) page.
{% endhint %}

2. **Project Cards:** On the main page, you will see the project cards. Each card represents an individual open source project. When you click on a project card, it takes you to a dedicated [**Overview Page**](../../project-overview-page/) for that project. These cards show you real-time data about each project, such as important numbers and updates.
