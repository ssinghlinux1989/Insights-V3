# All Projects

The new version of **Insights** gives you even greater visibility into your project’s performance. This new version provides support for Git and GitHub.

As a project leader, maintainer, administrator, or anyone wanting to understand the overall health of a project, these metrics are important:&#x20;

* The number of active contributors&#x20;
* The increase in contributor growth&#x20;
* Contributor Drift Pull request&#x20;
* Cycle time&#x20;
* Lines of Code Added and Removed

To analyze the key metrics of the **All Projects** dashboard for your project, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Insights](https://insights-v2.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) login page and login with your LF account. <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/All project (1).png" alt="" data-size="original">
