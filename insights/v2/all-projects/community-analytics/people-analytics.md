## Calculating Community Management Metrics

Community Management Metrics is derived based on the number of commits submitted, number of pull requests managed and total number of issues submitted and closed for a project.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Commmm.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Community Management Metrics</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
For the current release, GitHub and Git are the two data sources used to calculate commits and pull requests. GitHub is the data source to calculate issues.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **Commits**&#x20;

A commit is an operation which sends the latest changes of the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository.

Commits includes the following:

* Commits Authored: These are the number commits where the author of the commit is the selected user. The number is a hyperlink and on click opens a modal that shows the LOC ++ (added) and LOC --(deleted)
* Commits Co-Authored: These are the number commits where the user has been a co-author.

On click of the **Commits**, you can view the following details:

* Lines of code added
* Lines of code deleted
* Lines of code co-authored

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Lines of commit.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Commits</p></figcaption></figure>

A commit in GitHub is an individual change which has been been done on a single or group of files. When you make a commit to save your work for a file, GitHub creates a unique ID (which is "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record for the specific changes committed along with when and who made those changes.

A commit in Git can be thought of as snapshots or milestones along the timeline of a Git project. Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time.

**Commit Process**

Visit the [GitHub Commit process](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) link for more information.&#x20;

### **Pull Requests**

Pull requests (PR) is a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Once a pull request is sent, other members can look over your code. The pull request can be marked for review, and engineering team can add questions or comments to it. Eventually, a project maintainer will decide whether or not the pull request should merge with the rest of the code.

{% hint style="info" %}
In GitHub, we use the term Pull Request and in Gerrit, we refer it as Changesets.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

On click of **Pull Request,** you can view the following details:

* Submitted
* Reviewed
* Merged
* Comments&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Pul Req.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Pull Requests </p></figcaption></figure>
