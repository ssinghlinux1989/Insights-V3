# Visa Letters

Visa letters are needed for events with international participants. They provide official documentation to support visa applications, helping attendees obtain travel documentation to enter the host country.

Providing visa letters helps expedite the visa application procedure and ensures that event attendees receive the required travel documents to enter the host country.
