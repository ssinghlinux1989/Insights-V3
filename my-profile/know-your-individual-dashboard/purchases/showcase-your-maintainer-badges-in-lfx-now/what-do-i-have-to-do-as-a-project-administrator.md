# What do I have to do as a Project Administrator?

### 1. **Ensure that your maintainer list is up to date in community management.**

1. Currently, LF Project Administrators can gain access to community management in our new version of [Insights](https://insights-v2.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/). To gain access**,** create a support ticket and provide the following details:&#x20;

* Your LFID.
* Your email registered with this LFID.
* The Project you need access to.

2\. In Community Management, mark your projectâ€™s maintainers as a maintainer by selecting the 3 dots to the right and selecting **Add Maintainer** Tag.
