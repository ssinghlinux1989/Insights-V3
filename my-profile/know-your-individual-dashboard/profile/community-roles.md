# Community Roles

To view the roles you hold or have been elected to as an active member of the open-source community, follow these steps:

1. Log in to [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev)
2. Scroll down to the **Community** **Roles** section.

The **Community** **Roles** are populated automatically based on the individual's assigned roles in different project communities. You can view the following information for each role:

* Project Name for which you have the role
* Committee Name
* Role names, such as Lead, Chair, LF Staff, and so on
* Start and end date associated with the role

If you are a point of contact on behalf of your company, which is a partner of the Linux Foundation and its projects, then your role in the context of your employer's participation in the project is also displayed. These roles are assigned by your company administrator during the membership enrollment process.
