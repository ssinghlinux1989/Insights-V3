# Training Enrollment

Your participation in open source training hosted by the Linux Foundation is automatically discovered. Your learning may be published on **LFX Insights Community** dashboards and your **Organization** dashboards, recognizing your efforts.

The section will display the following details:

* If you have not enrolled into trainings, the **Take Advantages of Linux Foundation Training Programs** CTA button navigates you to the Linux Foundation Training course catalogues.
* If your training enrollments are not displayed, for any reason, Click **Request Addition** to raise a support ticket to get your training enrollment added to your profile.
