# Travel Funding

A travel funding request is a formal request made by an individual or group to a funding source, such as an employer or organization, to pay the expenses of attending an event, such as travel, accommodation, meals, and registration fees.

* The request includes a detailed budget and justification for the request.
* The funding source assesses the request based on various factors, including budget and significance to their objectives.
* The decision to approve or deny the request depends on the funding source's evaluation of the request.
