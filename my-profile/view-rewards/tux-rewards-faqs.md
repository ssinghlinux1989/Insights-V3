# TUX Rewards FAQs

### What is a Tux Rewards membership?

Tux Rewards Membership is our loyalty program that rewards you for purchasing training and certification from us! There is no fee, and it’s easy to join! You earn 1 point for every $1 spent with us, up to 500 per day. 500 points earn you a 50% off coupon code to be used toward (1) one course, certification exam, bundle, or boot camp.

### How do I receive 50% discount coupons for LF training or certifications?

Connect your GitHub and LinkedIn accounts to receive a 50% discount coupon for LF training or certification.

{% hint style="info" %}
1. This is a one-time reward and you can get a maximum of 500 reward points.
2. If you already have 500 reward points applied to your profile or have been previously rewarded 500 points, you will not qualify for these new 500 points.
3. Complete the following steps:
   1. Connect to your [Github account](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/my-profile/know-your-individual-dashboard/about-me/profile#connect-linkedin-account). You can connect as many Github accounts as you like, but the reward point will be granted only once per identity.
   2. Populate your work history by connecting your LinkedIn account.
   3. Complete your project affiliations. This ensures that you have some code contributions (at least 1) that you can affiliate with some organizations or as an individual.
4. The reward points are awarded to a single LF profile.
5. The coupon for 50% off is generated as soon as the above conditions are met. You can link your accounts independently and then perform affiliations later.
