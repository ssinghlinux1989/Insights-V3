# Health Metrics

Health Metrics provides you with a dashboard for all onboarded projects that shows a quick snapshot of the project health by combining metrics from the [OSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) project and the [CNCF CLOMonitor](https://github.com/cncf/clomonitor) project to compute an overall best practices score to the projects.&#x20;

The main aim of this feature it to provide visibility to the projects on areas to improve as per the OSS best practices guidelines for project setup and also keep a check on the health and take immediate actions when the same starts deteriorating.
