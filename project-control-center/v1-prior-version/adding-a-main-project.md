# Adding a Main Project

You can host your project in the Linux Foundation. Once the company decides to host its project on the Linux Foundation, you (administrator) needs to create a project for every new company that hosts their projects or foundation on Linux Foundation using PCC.

As a administrator, you need to create the projects and sub projects as per the needs of the company.

To add a main project on the PCC, perform the following steps:

1.Login into PCC.
