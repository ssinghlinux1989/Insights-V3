## Flexible Scheduling of a Meeting&#x20;

PCC provides the flexibility to update the scheduled meetings. Flexible scheduling allows the administrators to modify the meeting based on the requirements that change on day to day basis.  Flexible scheduling allows you to:

* Update the time of any single occurrence of a recurring meeting series. For example, you can prepone or postpone the meeting for a particular date of a recurring meeting. You can only update the time for single occurrence and not the complete series of meetings.&#x20;
* Cancel the meeting of a single occurrence of a recurring meeting. For example, you can cancel the meeting for a single occurrence of a particular day of a recurring meeting. If there is any holiday, you can cancel the meeting for that day.&#x20;
* Change or cancel a single event which arises due to attendee conflicts and holidays.
* Add or remove a participant for a particular occurrence of a recurring meeting.&#x20;
