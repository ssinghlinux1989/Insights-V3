## Delegate DNS

Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers, services, and other resources reachable through the internet or other internet protocol networks. DNS converts human readable domain names to machine readable IP addresses.

DNS Delegation is nothing but providing rights from one resource to another resource. Delegations allows the servers in one zone to refer clients to servers in other zones.
