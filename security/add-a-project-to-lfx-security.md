# Add a Project to LFX Security

LFX Security hosts open source projects that show security vulnerability information in the Vulnerability Report.

If your project is not hosted on LFX Security, you can submit a project application.

**To submit a project:**

1. [Log in](../sso/sign-in/) to [LFX Security](https://security.lfx.linuxfoundation.org).
2. Click **Secure My Project**, you will be redirected to PCC. You have to onboard the project from PCC. Refer [Onboarding your Project section](onboarding-your-project.md) for more information.
