# What is Insights V3

Insights V3 is an open source analytical tool that provides insights from analyzing open source software (OSS) projects.

Insights V3 helps project leads and technical managers understand their team members' engagement and participation in open source projects, and identify the most active and productive contributors.

The tool has many features that can be very useful in a number of ways, such as:

1. **Data Visualization and Reporting:** Insights will use data visualization techniques to make it easier to understand the metrics and reports generated by the software.
2. **Code Analysis:** Insights V3 analyzes the project's codebase for metrics such as code complexity, and code quality that help project leads and managers identify potential areas for improvement.
3. **Development metrics:** Metrics such as commit frequency, pull request acceptance rates, and time-to-resolution for issues can provide insights into the project's development process and help project leads and managers identify areas for improvement.
4. **Integration with other tools:** Integration with other tools commonly used in software development, such as Git, GitHub, or Jira, can provide a more competent view of the project's development and make it easier for contributors and managers to track progress.
5. **Customization and flexibility:** Providing users with the ability to customize the analytics tool to fit their specific needs and workflows can increase its usefulness and adoption.
